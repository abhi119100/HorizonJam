## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

### **Traditional Signal Processing (Librosa)**
**Results**: A Major (2 semitones off)
- **Frequency Range**: 49.3 - 82.4 Hz (bass only)
- **Method**: PYIN pitch detection + Chroma analysis
- **Problem**: Focused on low-frequency harmonics/artifacts
- **Accuracy**: 0% (completely wrong key)

### **Neural Network (BasicPitch)**
**Results**: G Major (exactly correct)
- **Frequency Range**: E1 - F7 (full spectrum)
- **Method**: Deep learning trained on musical data
- **Advantage**: Understands harmonic context
- **Accuracy**: 100% (perfect detection)

## 🎼 Why Traditional Methods Failed

### **1. Frequency Analysis Issues**
- **Wrong focus**: Analyzed bass frequencies (49-82 Hz)
- **Missed fundamentals**: Ignored mid-range harmonics where melody lives
- **Harmonic confusion**: Mistook overtones for root notes

### **2. Algorithm Limitations**
- **No musical context**: Pure signal processing without harmonic understanding
- **Chroma artifacts**: Low-frequency content skewed note class detection
- **Pitch detection errors**: PYIN confused by complex harmonic content

### **3. Scale Detection Problems**
- **Pattern matching**: Simple note-counting doesn't understand chord progressions
- **No temporal analysis**: Missed chord changes over time
- **Spectral noise**: Random harmonics influenced scale classification

## 🧠 Why Neural Networks Succeed

### **1. Musical Training Data**
- **Real-world examples**: Trained on actual songs and instruments
- **Harmonic relationships**: Learned chord structures and progressions
- **Context awareness**: Understands what makes musical sense

### **2. Advanced Processing**
- **Multi-layer analysis**: Processes multiple frequency ranges simultaneously
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies musical patterns vs noise
- **Temporal understanding**: Tracks chord changes over time

### **3. Robust Feature Extraction**
- **Fundamental vs harmonics**: Distinguishes root notes from overtones
- **Instrument awareness**: Handles different timbres and playing styles
- **Noise filtering**: Ignores non-musical artifacts
